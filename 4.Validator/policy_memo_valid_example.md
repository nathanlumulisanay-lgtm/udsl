# Executive Summary
Our analysis concludes that implementing a unified data governance framework will reduce compliance risks by 28% within the first year. This memo provides the necessary rationale and recommended actions for immediate board approval.

# Background
The organization faces increasing regulatory complexity across markets, leading to fragmented documentation and inconsistent accountability.

# Analysis
Using internal audit data (Q1–Q3), we observe a direct correlation between inconsistent documentation and repeat compliance incidents. Comparable organizations reduced risk exposure by standardizing document governance.

# Recommendation
Approve the rollout of a unified governance framework and mandate standardization across all departments.

# Implementation
Phase 1 rollout within 60 days. Phase 2 covers all international teams within 120 days. Quarterly audits track adoption and accuracy.
