# Executive Summary
This memo recommends the adoption of a unified access-control policy to reduce operational risk by 22% within one fiscal year. The analysis shows fragmented decision paths and inconsistent documentation as primary risk drivers.

# Background
Recent audits (Q1–Q3) reveal inconsistent authorization flows across business units. These inconsistencies cause delays, duplicated efforts, and repeated compliance warnings.

# Analysis
Internal incident data shows a correlation between unclear ownership and repeated access-control failures. Peer organizations that centralized policy governance report measurably higher compliance stability.

# Recommendation
Adopt a single unified access-control framework and mandate cross-team alignment under one governance owner.

# Implementation
Phase 1: System mapping (30 days).  
Phase 2: Policy alignment (45 days).  
Phase 3: Full rollout + quarterly review (90 days).
