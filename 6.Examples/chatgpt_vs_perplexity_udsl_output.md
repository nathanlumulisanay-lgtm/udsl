## 1. ChatGPT
- Strong adherence to section order.
- Balanced tone.
- Handles Toulmin reasoning reliably.

## 2. Perplexity
- Very clear and concise.
- Sometimes compresses structure if not reminded.
- Excellent factual grounding.
- Needs explicit section headings reminders.

## Summary
Both models produce reliable long-form content under UDSL,  
but Perplexity tends to shorten content unless instructed not to.

UDSL removes structural drift across models.
