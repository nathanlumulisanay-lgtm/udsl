# UDSL — Universal Document Structure Layer (v1.0)

**UDSL (Universal Document Structure Layer)** is the world’s first **AI-native, model-agnostic document structure standard.**

It defines how AI systems (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Perplexity) should:

- structure long-form documents,
- apply reasoning modes,
- route tone and style,
- respect UX writing rules,
- and stay consistent in terminology.

UDSL is part of **RenMetrix — LOOM Protocol**.  
Author: **Nathan Lumulisanay**

## 🌐 What is UDSL?

UDSL is a **canonical 5-layer standard** for AI-generated documents:

1. **Structure Layer**  
   Defines outlines, required/optional sections, ordering and document types.

2. **Reasoning Schema Layer**  
   Defines how arguments are built (Toulmin, deductive, inductive, scenario-based).

3. **Style & Tone Routing Layer**  
   Defines tone profiles and voice constraints per audience and doc_type.

4. **UX Writing Layer**  
   Defines paragraph density, headings, CTAs, scannability and clarity.

5. **Terminology Layer**  
   Defines term lists, synonyms, banned terms and normalization rules.

The goal:  
> **Every long-form document generated by AI should be structurally consistent, explainable, auditable and aligned with its audience.**
